## Module A: Culture Vessel

This module involves design of the heated vessel and connections for various sensors and devices required to monitor and intervene in the bioreactor run.

### Design Goals

 - Glass, autoclavable bottle
 - Have low-cost connectors for the inputs and sensors that maintain sterility
 - Hold around 1L culture with plenty of air space (~ 2 L volume)

We looked at typical culture vessels supplied by lab brands such as Duran but the cost was prohibitive (Â£200 for a wide-mouthed Duran bottle and an additional for the lid with bioreactor attachments).


### Anti-Foam

Agitation can lead to bubbling in E.coli cultures to it is often necessary to add anti-foam chemicals. Low-cost and commonly available anti-foam agents include olive oil, sunflower oil, silicone, polyethylene glycol.
