## Module A: Culture Vessel

This module involves design of the heated vessel and connections for various sensors and devices required to monitor and intervene in the bioreactor run.

### Design Goals

 - Glass, autoclavable bottle
 - Have low-cost connectors for the inputs and sensors that maintain sterility
 - Hold around 1L culture with plenty of air space (~ 2 L volume)

We looked at typical culture vessels supplied by lab brands such as Duran but the cost was prohibitive (£200 for a wide-mouthed Duran bottle and an additional for the lid with bioreactor attachments).

### Adhesive for connection of items in autoclavable units

Adhesives should be autoclavable i.e. have high heat, humidity and pressure resistance. Various adhesives companies market epoxy resins with these properties to the medical device market e.g.those produced by [MasterBond](https://www.masterbond.com/properties/sterilization-resistant-adhesives) and 

**Required features: **

 - Should withstand multiple autoclaving cycles of 3-15 minutes at 121-134°C under steam pressure up to 20 psi.
 - Pressure resistant to 20 psi
 - Maximum operating temperature above 121 C
 - Oil and water resistant
 - Non-corrosive
 - [If applicable] Biocompatible. Depending on if the adhesive will be in contact with the biological material in the reactor, it would be worth looking at biocompatability. Any material with USP Class VI certification is medical grade and considered to be biocompatible.
 
A potential lower cost solution (without biocompatability considerations) is to look to automobile ranges with silicon gasket makers and adhesives designed for vehicle parts that reach high temperatures.

### Autoclavable luer locks


### Anti-Foam

Agitation can lead to bubbling in E.coli cultures to it is often necessary to add anti-foam chemicals. Low-cost and commonly available anti-foam agents include olive oil, sunflower oil, silicone, polyethylene glycol.
