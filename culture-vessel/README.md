We looked at typical culture vessels supplied by lab brands such as Duran but the cost was prohibitive (£200 for a wide-mouthed Duran bottle and an additional £90 for the lid with bioreactor attachments). 

This option was discounted and we turned to catering suppliers for ideas of alternative vessels.

We found 2L glass preserving jars that are widely available and can fit metal lids that would be autoclavable. We chose a [Le Parfait Orange Top Jar, 2.0L](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Parfait-Orange-Top-Jar-2-0L/dp/B01N91TANW) with [Familia Wiss lids](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Le-Parfait-Spare-Lids/dp/B002G6G73U/ref=sr_1_1?s=kitchen&ie=UTF8&qid=1540499155&sr=1-1&keywords=Le+Parfait+6+Familia+Wiss+lids) but any products of similar size and made from glass and metal could be substituted.

## Connection of tubing, sensors and actuators to the lid

There are a range of silicon tubes, sensors and agitation devices that need to be mounted on the lid in such as way that they the internal components can be autoclaved with the device and the connections are airtight to avoid contamination during operation of the bioreactor.

### Adhesive Choice

Adhesives should be autoclavable i.e. have high heat, humidity and pressure resistance. Various adhesives companies market epoxy resins with these properties to the medical device market e.g.those produced by [MasterBond](https://www.masterbond.com/properties/sterilization-resistant-adhesives) and 

**Required features:**

 - Should withstand multiple autoclaving cycles of 3-15 minutes at 121-134°C under steam pressure up to 20 psi.
 - Pressure resistant to 20 psi
 - Maximum operating temperature above 121 C
 - Oil and water resistant
 - Non-corrosive
 - [If applicable] Biocompatible. Depending on if the adhesive will be in contact with the biological material in the reactor, it would be worth looking at biocompatability. Any material with USP Class VI certification is medical grade and considered to be biocompatible.
 
A potential lower cost solution (without biocompatability considerations) is to look to automobile ranges with silicon gasket makers and adhesives designed for vehicle parts that reach high temperatures.

**Chosen gasket maker**:

**Chosen adhesive resin**: JB Weld Original Cold Weld Formula Steel Reinforced Epoxy 8265 ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0006O1ICE/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&psc=1) | [Manufacturer] (https://www.jbweld.com/collections/metal/products/j-b-weld-twin-tube))

### Plastic Choice

There are numerous sites giving information on compatability of different plastics with different sterilisation methods, including this [useful table](http://www.industrialspec.com/images/files/plastics-sterilization-compatibility-chart-from-is-med-specialties.pdf) from industrialspec.com.

Ensinger Plastics ran tests with plastics exposed to pure saturated water vapour at 134 °C for 10 min at 3 bar pressure. This is in accordance with DIN EN 285 European standard for large steam sterilisers, whereby all surfaces of the objects being sterilised must be exposed to pure saturated water vapour at 134 °C for at least three minutes.

**Required features:**

 - Low coefficient of thermal expansion
 - Low moisture absorption
 - Temperature resistance up to 134 C

#### Filament Options for 3D printing

Alex Kutschera [tested PLA for autoclavability](https://github.com/BioMakers/2018-opensourcebioreactor/blob/master/autoclave_PLA.md) and found that the structural integrity was severely compromised after five rounds of autoclaving as the plastic became brittle. He estimates that it could undergo more cycles (up to 10) with little shape deformity as long as no pressure is applied.

Autoclavable 3D printing filaments are largely restricted to Polyether ether ketone (PEEK) filament and polyetherimide (PEI, brand name ULTEM). However, the polyaryletherketone (PAEK) class of semi-crystalline plastics can also withstand high temperatures and maintain high mechanical strength.

PEI is the most affordable option and has high heat, solvent and flame resistance, as well as high dielectric strength, thermal conductivity and overall strength. PEEK has higher impact strength and usable temperature. Both require all-metal 3D printing nozzles and temperature control in the heating chamber to be effectively printed. Several companies sell inclubated chambers for printing at high temperatures and NASA modified the [open hardware Lulzbot printer](https://www.lulzbot.com/learn/NASA-high-temperature-printing) to print PEI by adding infrared lights, as described in a technical report [(Gardner et al., 2016)](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20170000214.pdf).

Due the restrictions on materials and modifications required, for v1 we did not 3D print any parts. For those who are able to, there are good guides [here](https://www.sculpteo.com/blog/2017/03/29/3d-printed-screw-threads-which-material-which-design/) and [here](https://formlabs.com/blog/adding-screw-threads-3d-printed-parts/) to printing screw threads and other fittings.

### Autoclavable locks

The interface locks need to be sterilisable and avoid contamination during operation. We looked to medical connectors to offer a more widely available option than specialist lab equipment.

**Luer Locks**

<img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41G0BQ39WYL.jpg" height="180" align="left"> 

[Luer locks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luer_taper) are standardised threaded mechanisms for joining tubing and connectors, commonly used in lab and medical settings. They are defined by [ISO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standards_Organization) [594 standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luer_taper#cite_note-3), [DIN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIN "DIN") and [EN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_standard "European standard") standards [1707:1996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luer_taper#cite_note-4) and [20594-1:1993](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luer_taper#cite_note-5).

They are available in autoclavable metal and PEEK and their use in medical applications and hydraulic systems means they are more likely to be available in numerous places. The cost per lock is £16-60 from lab supply companies and considerably less from medical and industrial suppliers.

**Quick Disconnect Couplings**

Quick disconnect couplings are also available in [metal and polypropylene](https://www.industrialspec.com/shop/medical-component-products/medical-quick-disconnect-couplings.html) and could be used for the purpose of connecting tubes and sensors.

In v1 we have used a less specialist combination of the following:

 - Rubber washers 
 - Rubber grommets 
 - High temperature resistant silicon gasket maker
 - Rivet nuts
 
These are the most widely available options but not a secure as the interlocking mechanisms above and would not be suitable for devices operating under significant pressure.
