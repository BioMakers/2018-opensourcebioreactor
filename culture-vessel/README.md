## Module A: Culture Vessel

This module involves design of the heated vessel and connections for various sensors and devices required to monitor and intervene in the bioreactor run.

### Design Goals

 - Glass, autoclavable bottle
 - Have low-cost connectors for the inputs and sensors that maintain sterility
 - Hold around 1L culture with plenty of air space (~ 2 L volume)
